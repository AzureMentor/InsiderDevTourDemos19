# Myth Busting PWA

There's a PWA demo app that will help you playing the session deployed here: [https://mbp.azurewebsites.net](https://mbp.azurewebsites.net/). Please install it on your machine using the **Edge Dev** (chromium based) install button in the omnibox. It contains links to all other demos either embedded directly inside the PWA (light blue buttons) or will open the link to an external browser window (dark blue). 

In case of a failure, you'll find the code / VS solution backup of the PWA Demo app to install on your machine in the **PWADemoApp** folder.
